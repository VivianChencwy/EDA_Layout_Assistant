# Automated Matching System Design for Resistors and Capacitors in Analog IC Layout
This project focuses on the design of an automated matching system for resistors and capacitors in analog integrated circuit (IC) layouts. In analog IC design, precise matching of resistors and capacitors is critical, as device mismatches can significantly impact overall circuit performance. Traditionally, integrated resistors and capacitors exhibit large errors (±20% to ±30%). This project aims to optimize the layout of these matching devices by developing an automated layout system to reduce mismatch rates.

The research emphasizes the identification and implementation of optimal matching rules for resistor and capacitor layouts using automation tools. The project employs the Python programming language and the gdstk library to develop an Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool for automated layout generation. By defining matching rules and leveraging heuristic algorithms, the system optimizes device placement to minimize mismatches. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulation techniques are used to evaluate the performance of the generated layouts, validating the effectiveness of the automated approach.

Simulation results demonstrate that the automated matching layouts significantly improve the matching accuracy of resistors and capacitors compared to traditional manual layouts, reducing mismatches caused by process variations. Although parasitic capacitance in capacitor layouts, due to unoptimized routing, slightly affects performance, the automated layout tool shows clear advantages in shortening design cycles and enhancing design efficiency.

Future work will focus on optimizing routing algorithms, expanding matching rules to accommodate diverse process requirements, and developing a more user-friendly design interface to improve reliability and efficiency. These enhancements are expected to make the automated matching layout tool more practical and competitive in the field of analog IC design.
