# Analog IC Matching Layout Tool

This project develops an **automated layout system** for matching resistors and capacitors in analog integrated circuit (IC) designs. Precise matching is critical to minimize errors that impact circuit performance. Built with Python and the `gdstk` library, this tool optimizes device layouts to reduce mismatch rates, streamlining the design process.

## Features

- **Automated Layout Generation**: Creates optimized resistor and capacitor layouts using matching rules and heuristic algorithms.
- **Resistor Matching**: Supports interdigitated structures, symmetric arrangements, and user-defined parameters like magnification.
- **Capacitor Matching**: Uses 2D arrays with simulated annealing for dispersion optimization and square-shaped designs.
- **Performance Validation**: Employs Monte Carlo simulations to test mismatch rates under process variations.
- **EDA Integration**: Outputs GDSII files compatible with IC design workflows.

## Why It Matters

In analog ICs, resistors and capacitors often have errors of ±20–30%. This tool automates the layout of matching devices, ensuring similar process conditions and reducing mismatches. Compared to manual layouts, it improves accuracy and cuts design time.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **gdstk**: For GDSII file generation and polygon drawing.
- **Simulated Annealing**: Optimizes capacitor array dispersion.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Evaluates layout performance.

### Matching Rules
- **Resistors**: Identical geometries, same material, aligned orientation, interdigitated arrays, optional even-segment arrays.
- **Capacitors**: Square shapes, same material, aligned centroids, cross-coupled arrays, compact square-like layouts.

### Workflow
1. Define resistor/capacitor values and layout preferences.
2. Generate layouts using heuristic algorithms for optimal matching.
3. Output GDSII files for resistors (symmetric or even-segment) and capacitors (2D arrays).
4. Validate with Monte Carlo simulations to measure mismatch rates.

## Results

- **Resistors**: Reduced average mismatch by 37.5% and standard deviation by 14.3% compared to Cadence Virtuoso's standard layouts.
- **Capacitors**: Improved standard deviation by 48.9%, but parasitic capacitance from manual routing increased average mismatch.
- **Efficiency**: Significantly shortened design cycles compared to manual methods.
